          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: What are salons?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: An Interintellect salon is akin to a cozy living room gathering, where participants engage in an evening-length conversation about a specific topic, typically lasting one to three hours. These salons are characterized by their in-depth discussions, but they can also take the form of creative workshops, art performances, and dialogues with special guests, among other formats (refer to Event Types for more details).
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: What can I expect if I host a salon?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: As a host, you can anticipate engaging in profound and thoughtful conversations with attendees, each bringing their unique perspectives to the topic at hand. Hosting a salon provides you with the opportunity to steer these dynamic discussions. Ideal hosts are those eager to delve into deep, inclusive dialogues on subjects they are passionate about, with an audience that shares their enthusiasm.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Additionally, hosting can be a valuable platform to promote your own ventures such as podcasts, newsletters, or video channels. It can serve as a brainstorming session for upcoming books or articles, enhance your conversational and public speaking skills, help you forge connections with like-minded individuals, allow you to explore new ideas, and even offer a potential income stream.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: Is this like a formal TED Talk or presentation?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: No, it&apos;s different. Interintellect hosts don&apos;t need to be experts or content creators, although experts do find success on the platform. Instead, anyone who is genuinely interested in a topic and eager to learn alongside salon attendees can be an excellent host. Non-expert hosts create lively, exploratory events where the audience is just as much a part of the experience as the host.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Rather than a &apos;presenter,&apos; think of the host as a catalyst for conversation, ensuring active participation and a smooth flow of discussion. They do this by posing thought-provoking questions and sharing personal insights, fostering an interactive and engaging event.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: Who comes to salons?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Most salons are open to the general public, meaning anyone who buys a ticket can attend. Participants can range from established experts and passionate practitioners to curious hobbyists from various fields, often creating a diverse mix of perspectives.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Many attendees are also members of the Interintellect community. Salons are promoted to the wider public and the community through social media, the Interintellect Weekly Newsletter, and word-of-mouth. Hosts are encouraged to promote their salons through similar channels.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: Is this similar to voice apps like Clubhouse?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Not at all! Unlike Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, Interintellect&apos;s online salons are private, requiring a ticket or RSVP to join. With a typical cap of 40 guests (which can be adjusted), these gatherings offer an intimate space where participants can speak directly without any hierarchical barriers. The environment resembles a virtual living room gathering.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            In contrast to voice apps, Interintellect salons are long-form conversations lasting one to three hours, often featuring suggested readings or thought-provoking questions for attendees to consider beforehand. Interintellect also hosts in-person salons (Interintellect IRL events) in collaboration with partner organizations, special guests, and prominent hosts, setting itself apart from purely virtual discussion spaces.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: If I join as a host, how many salons am I required to do in total?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: There&apos;s no set requirement for how many salons you need to host. New hosts, however, may benefit from hosting frequently to develop their skills through practice. It can also be helpful to start with topics you&apos;re more familiar with before branching out and experimenting with new ones.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: What are the expectations to join as a host?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: We only ask that you align with Interintellect&apos;s hosting ethos, follow the procedures for becoming a host (outlined below), share your upcoming salons enthusiastically, and engage with those eager to participate in your events.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Remember, the Interintellect team and community members are always available to help. Feel free to pitch your ideas to a team member for feedback or guidance.

            Q: What is the procedure for becoming a host?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Click here to create your host account, then join the Interintellect Discord to connect with fellow hosts and community members.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Next, list your first salon or series. Refer to our salon examples and templates page for inspiration. Your “Welcome Package,” which will be sent to your inbox, contains all the essential information you need to start hosting.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            To publish your salon or series, you must complete three tasks within 24 hours of submission: set up your payment information, submit the W9 form (for U.S. taxpayers) or W8-BEN form (for non-U.S. taxpayers), and create a new Zoom account to share with us. We&apos;ll upgrade your account to a paid version for free, and you&apos;ll be ready to go!

            Pricing
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: Who pays for this? How much does it cost?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Your audience pays to attend your salon, with the host setting the ticket price and earning a portion from each sale.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Interintellect hosts receive 70% of the ticket price for all paid tickets. The remaining 30% is either the Interintellect platform fee (for non-members) or a 30% discount for Interintellect members. Therefore, hosts always receive 70% of the revenue, regardless of the attendee&apos;s membership status. You also have the flexibility to offer free tickets via special codes, in which case neither the host nor Interintellect receives any share.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Interintellect provides a platform for your salon and offers marketing support through our social media channels and newsletter. You can even inquire about being interviewed for the Interintellect blog or podcast. The rest is up to you!

            Preparing to Host
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How do I know if my idea will make a good salon topic?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Almost any idea can evolve into a fantastic salon topic if framed well. To prepare, ask yourself questions like: What are the core questions that truly explore this topic? What different perspectives should be considered and balanced?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            The most compelling salon descriptions often feature thought-provoking questions or paradoxes that stir curiosity, drawing potential attendees eager to explore further.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            If you&apos;re in the Interintellect Discord, it&apos;s an excellent place to gather feedback and gauge interest from the community. You can also post your question on Twitter and tag @interintellect_; we&apos;ll retweet it and help you find the answers you need.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How do you craft an appealing event description? How much detail should I include?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Start by introducing yourself (we&apos;ll link to your Twitter or personal website). Then, write a paragraph or two outlining the topic and why you&apos;re interested in it. Add a few key questions you&apos;ll explore at the salon and, if applicable, provide suggested readings or links. You can find some great examples of event descriptions and templates here.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How do you find brainstorming buddies or co-hosts?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: The Interintellect Discord is a fantastic place to connect with others. Otherwise, consider friends or colleagues who could offer a fresh perspective on the topic or those you enjoy interacting with on Twitter. These are excellent people to approach for collaboration.

            Q: When promoting, how do you cut through the noise of social media?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: While we&apos;ll assist with promotion, an engaged host can significantly enhance a salon&apos;s success. Reach out via email, direct message your Twitter friends, post in the relevant Discord channels, connect with your real-life friends, and consider writing an essay for our blog. There are plenty of ways to spread the word!
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How do you prepare for different-sized salons, large vs. small?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: As your salon size increases, small adjustments may be necessary. One key difference is in how you handle introductions. For larger salons, you might need to keep introductions brief, focusing on names, locations, and something interesting they found in the readings. In smaller salons, you can encourage deeper connections by starting with a longer activity, such as sharing personal reflections on the readings.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: If a conversation goes off track or a few attendees dominate, how do you steer it back?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: A good way to redirect the conversation is to invite those who haven&apos;t had a chance to speak to share their thoughts and contribute to the discussion.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: What are good ways to create an engaging conversation?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Interintellect attracts people worldwide from a variety of cultural backgrounds. The most engaging conversations are those that embrace multiple perspectives, so use this diversity to gain fresh insights into the topic at hand.

            Hosting a Series
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How often should I run the salons?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Many series salons are scheduled monthly, at the same time and day each month (e.g., the first Thursday of the month at 8 p.m. EU time). However, hosts have also run series bi-weekly or even weekly. Some series last just a few weeks, while others extend to a year or even indefinitely.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How far in advance should I list my series?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Series should be listed at least one month before their start, with each individual salon episode being made available three weeks in advance. You can refer to this example for guidance.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How much do series tickets cost for community members vs. non-community members?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Hosts are free to set their ticket prices. Series tickets are exclusively for community members, so non-members will be prompted to join Interintellect when purchasing. For instance, if a series ticket is priced at $150 for a year-long series, a member will pay $150, while a non-member will pay $284.99 ($150 plus $134.99 for an annual Interintellect membership).
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How many tickets are sold?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: The standard upper limit is 40 tickets, but adjustments can be made if needed. For in-person salons, our COVID protocol currently limits the number to 15 (this may change, so feel free to inquire for updated information).
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: Can people buy tickets for individual salons within the series?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: This is up to the host. Some prefer to offer both series and individual episode tickets, while others choose one option exclusively. Make sure to specify your preferences in your series submission.

            Hosting a SuperSalon
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: What is the difference between a salon and a SuperSalon?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: SuperSalons are events featuring a special guest, often a recognized expert in their field. More time is typically given to the guest at the beginning, while still allowing for questions and group participation. These discussions are generally recorded and shared on the Interintellect YouTube channel, unless the host or guest requests otherwise.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: How are payments handled for SuperSalons?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Interintellect offers flexible payment options for SuperSalon hosts. You can choose one of the following approaches for handling the proceeds:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Typography paragraph>
                a. Keep the full payment for yourself.
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography paragraph>
                b. Split the proceeds between yourself and the guest(s)/other host(s) (e.g., 50/50 or 33/33/33).
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography paragraph>
                c. Donate the earnings to Interintellect.
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography paragraph>
                d. Donate the proceeds to a chosen organization.
              </Typography>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Please note that payments below $20 will accumulate until they exceed that amount. However, you can request a smaller payment within seven days after your salon if desired. If the host, co-host, or guest hasn&apos;t completed the Stripe onboarding process or provided bank details within three months, Interintellect reserves the right to withhold payments.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            When splitting or passing the proceeds to the guest, they can choose to join our Stripe payment system or receive an Interintellect membership equivalent to the earnings. Alternatively, the guest can gift subscriptions to friends in the Interintellect community.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            If the host wishes to give all proceeds to the guest, that&apos;s possible but should be communicated in advance. If a guest prefers to donate the proceeds to another organization, please contact us so we can support this arrangement.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            It&apos;s important to agree on the payment arrangement with the guest beforehand and notify the Interintellect team at hello@interintellect.com. If no alternative agreement is made, the default is to distribute revenue equally between the host(s) and guest(s), similar to co-hosted salon events.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            We&apos;ll follow up with the necessary information once we receive the notification!

            Q: What can I charge for an offline event? How do I manage attendance?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: Currently, our offline events are exclusively for members and are free to attend. Members can RSVP online and have the flexibility to rescind their RSVP if their plans change.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: I am hosting an IRL meetup. When do I need to provide the meeting details?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: For IRL events, hosts must share the physical location and other relevant details (e.g., bring blankets, refreshments, etc.) at least three days before the salon. We will then notify the RSVP&apos;d attendees three days before the event, along with a day-of reminder. If the information isn&apos;t provided at least three days in advance, the event will be canceled.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6">
            Q: Do I need to give an exact location, or can it be approximate?
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            A: You should provide a precise address or easily recognizable landmark (like in a park), so attendees can find you reliably, even if they only see the information on the day of the event. While it&apos;s not always possible to give an exact location (e.g., &apos;We&apos;ll be under this tree the whole time), ensure there&apos;s a clear way for attendees to locate you. If the meeting spot changes, promptly share the new location with participants and clearly communicate where the salon will be held.
